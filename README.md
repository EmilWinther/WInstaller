# WInstaller
Installer for myself when resetting my windows pc.

If your for some reason want to use my program, it's quite easy.
By default it has 6 programs that it installs, and they are all configured in the config json file. You can remove and add as you want. The url is the download url, you can usually get the download url by checking the request it makes, when you press download on the site, in the network tab in your inspection tool.
